# MyReads

Part of Udadicy's React Fundamentals course.

MyReads is an app that helps us to manage our reading list. As a user, we can put books into shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", or "Read". We can move the books around the shelves and remove them by selecting "None". We can also add new books to our shelves by using the search feature, which has the same selection interface.


## Setting up

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you prefer)
* start the development server with `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
* create a production bundle with `npm build` (or `yarn build`)
